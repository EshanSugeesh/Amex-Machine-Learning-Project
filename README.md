# Amex Machine Learning Project

## Objective
Modeled customer behavior and transaction patterns for the American Express (Amex) dataset to predict financial outcomes and inform strategic decision making.

## Dataset & Setup
- Worked with complex, high-dimensional datasets provided in multiple formats (CSV, Parquet) containing event, offer, and transaction records
- Integrated Google Colab and Google Drive for scalable data access and secure storage

## Pipeline & Engineering
- Extensive feature engineering with over **300 handcrafted features** capturing spending patterns, account activity, offer interactions, and event-based customer actions
- Applied data cleaning, missing value imputation, and robust encoding strategies to maximize model interpretability and reduce noise
- Leveraged the Amex data dictionary for precise mapping and validation

## Model Development
- Utilized advanced machine learning algorithms (Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, and Neural Networks) for large-scale predictive modeling
- Performed iterative model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation for optimal performance
- Built custom evaluation metrics aligned with competition objectives and business goals

## Submission & Reporting
- Generated prediction files in competition-ready format
- Codebase built for reproducibility: modular, well-documented workflow suitable for deployment and collaboration

## Impact
- Delivered actionable insights for customer segmentation, risk scoring, and offer targeting
- Demonstrated high proficiency in large-scale feature engineering, advanced ML pipelines, and cloud-based data science
- Project actively referenced in resume to highlight expertise in handling real-world, multi-source financial data and competitive ML modeling
